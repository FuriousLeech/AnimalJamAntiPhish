# AnimalJamAntiPhish
Use this to destroy someones Animal Jam phishing page. this spams them with fake information  that looks real. you can edit this for better use.
This is very simple. add more usernames etc for better results, so far there is only 21, however each time you run the program,
it randomizes the password/username out of 1 to 3 choices.


Created this for fun. Not sure if it works correctly. But from the looks of it, it does.
